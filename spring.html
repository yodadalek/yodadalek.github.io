           These past two springs have been life changing.
           We had been known each other longer and we 
           were hanging out more and even going on night walks.
           We also hungout at fuller park having picnics there, and I also got my concussion.
           However that didn't stop us and now we even went to prom together.
           It was so much fun taking picture and seeing you smile as you were living
           a dream.
